SyFramework Coding Standard ruleset for PHP_CodeSniffer.

This coding standard is almost like the [PSR12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/) with some main differences:
- The [K&R style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style#K&R_style) is used for classes, methods and functions instead of [Allman style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style#Allman_style)
- The **tab** character is used for indenting instead of **space** characters.
